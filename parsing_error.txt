the parsing thinks the map is incorrect whe it have tabs in the begining even tho it is closed.

this is another error "F 220,100,0," "C ,225,30,01" it should give an error

this here sigfault it "C -225,30,01"

it sigfault because you dont protect textures

if the texure name "NO" is less or more by even one char it sigfaults
